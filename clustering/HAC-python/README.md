# Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering in Python.

This implementation implements a range of distance metrics and clustering methods, like single-linkage clustering, group-average clustering and Ward or minimum variance clustering. 

The most interesting aspect of this implementation is that it provides functionality to perform Variability-based Neighbor Clustering (e.g. Gries & Hilpert 2006). This is a method of clustering in which the order of allowed clusters is predetermined.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- scipy (optional)
